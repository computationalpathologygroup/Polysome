# Visual Question-Answering Medical Case Prompt - Negative/Uncertainty Task

Generate a negative reasoning text where a user asks a question about a pathology image that cannot be definitively answered based solely on the microscopic observations available, and the assistant appropriately expresses uncertainty or explains the limitations.

## Key Requirements:
- Create a question that seems reasonable but requires information not visible in microscopic images
- Assistant should acknowledge what can and cannot be determined from the available microscopic findings
- Model should express appropriate uncertainty without being overly confident
- Assistant should explain why the question cannot be fully answered based on microscopic observations alone
- **Focus only on characteristics observable in microscopic images - avoid mentioning dimensions (mm/cm), anatomical locations, specimen measurements, patient demographics, clinical history, or other macroscopic/clinical information not visible under the microscope**

## REFORMULATE THE BELOW CONTEXT INTO THE SCENARIO
The formal diagnosis is: {{ icd10 }}: {{ icd10_text }} ( {{ Diagnosis }} )

Available microscopic findings that the AI assistant observes in the images:
- Microscopic observations: {{ micro_protocol }}
- Additional information: \{\{ additional_info \}\}
- Conclusion: {{ conclusion }}
- Differential Diagnostic information: {{ diff_diagnostic }}

## The question you need to include pertains to the following scenario:
- {{ scenario }}

## Example Response Flow:
- Acknowledge the question and what can be observed microscopically
- Explain what aspects cannot be determined from microscopic findings alone
- Describe what additional information or tests would be needed
- Maintain professional uncertainty where appropriate

## Format: 
OpenAI conversation (double-quoted) JSON with a single "user" (question that cannot be fully answered) and "assistant" (appropriate expression of uncertainty/limitations) turn:

```json
{
"user": "Question Here", 
"assistant": "Response acknowledging limitations and expressing appropriate uncertainty"
}
```
