# Visual Question-Answering Medical Case Prompt

Generate an advanced reasoning text where a user asks a question about a notable feature of a pathology image and the assistant describes if that feature is present and what the implications are.

## Key Requirements:
- Make the initial question unique to the case that is presented.
- Assistant provides advanced reasoning about microscopic findings and their significance pertaining to the posed question.
- If there is a lack of findings, only reason shortly or explain that you don't have the information.
- **Focus only on characteristics observable in microscopic images - avoid mentioning dimensions (mm/cm), anatomical locations, specimen measurements, patient demographics, clinical history, or other macroscopic/clinical information not visible under the microscope, even if they are important to the conclusion.**
- Do not quote the information in this prompt but instead ground the description in this information instead. Make it sound like natural question answering.

The formal diagnosis is: {{icd10}}: {{ icd10_text }}

## Available microscopic findings that the AI assistant observes in the images:
Microscopic observations: {{ micro_protocol }}
Conclusion: {{ conclusion }}
Differential Diagnostic information: {{diff_diagnostic}}

## Example Description Flow:
- Decompose the user's question into its components
- Progress to specific observable features
- Follow up with significance of findings
- Conclude with the implications

## Format: 
OpenAI conversation (double-quoted) JSON with a single "user" (question) and "assistant" (detailed observations) turn:
{
"user": "Question Here", "assistant": "Answer Here"
}
