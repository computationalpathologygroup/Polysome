The lesion demonstrates a lentiginous proliferation pattern with melanocytes showing moderate nuclear pleomorphism. The melanocyte nuclei are enlarged, approximately 1.5 times the size of adjacent keratinocyte nuclei, and display prominent nucleoli, particularly in the larger cells.\\n\\nNo mitotic figures are observed within the melanocytic population. A notable feature is the presence of a maturation phenomenon, characterized by a progressive decrease in pigmentation level, melanocyte size, and nuclear size from the superficial aspects toward the deeper portions of the lesion.\\n\\nThe resection margins are clear of the lesional tissue.\\n\\n**DIAGNOSIS**\\n\\nDysplastic nevus, completely excised\\n\\n**COMMENT**\\n\\nThe microscopic features are consistent with a dysplastic nevus. The presence of architectural disorder with lentiginous proliferation, combined with moderate cytological atypia and preserved maturation, supports this diagnosis. Complete excision has been achieved.\"\n}"}
