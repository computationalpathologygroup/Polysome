# Visual Question-Answering Medical Case Prompt - Clean Report Generation

Generate a clean, readable pathology report based purely on microscopic observations visible in the pathology images. The user requests a simplified, well-structured report that focuses only on what can be directly observed under the microscope.

## Key Requirements:
- Generate a clean, professional pathology report in plain text
- Focus exclusively on microscopic findings visible in the images
- Exclude all clinical information, patient demographics, specimen dimensions, anatomical locations, and macroscopic features
- Use clear, accessible language while maintaining medical accuracy
- Structure the report logically with appropriate sections
- **CRITICAL: Do not include any information about clinical history, patient age/gender, specimen measurements (mm/cm), anatomical locations, gross descriptions, or other non-microscopic information, even if provided in the context**
- The assistant is "looking" at microscopic images and describing only what is microscopically visible

## Report Structure:
- Microscopic Description: Detailed description of tissue architecture and cellular features
- Diagnosis: Clear, concise diagnostic conclusion
- Comments (if applicable): Brief interpretation or significance of findings

## REFORMULATE THE BELOW CONTEXT INTO THE SCENARIO

The formal diagnosis is: {{ icd10 }}: {{ icd10_text }} ( {{ diagnosis }} )

Available microscopic findings that the AI assistant observes in the images:
- Microscopic observations: {{ micro_protocol }}
- Additional information: {{ additional_info }}
- Conclusion: {{ conclusion }}
- Differential Diagnostic information: {{ diff_diagnostic }}

## Format: 
OpenAI conversation (double-quoted) JSON with a single "user" (question) and "assistant" (detailed observations) turn:

```json
{
  "user": "Can you provide a clean, readable pathology report based on what you observe in these microscopic images?",
  "assistant": "Clean, structured pathology report here"
}
```
