The lesion demonstrates a lentiginous proliferation pattern with melanocytes exhibiting moderate nuclear pleomorphism. The melanocyte nuclei display prominent nucleoli, particularly in the larger cells, and are approximately 1.5 times larger than the surrounding keratinocyte nuclei. No mitotic figures are observed within the melanocytic population. A notable feature is the maturation phenomenon, where there is a progressive reduction in pigmentation level, melanocyte size, and nuclear size from the superficial portions toward the deeper aspects of the lesion. The resection margins appear clear of the lesion. These microscopic findings are consistent with a dysplastic nevus that has been completely removed.\"\n  }"}
