# Visual Question-Answering Medical Case Prompt

Generate a detailed description where a user asks a question about what can be seen on pathology images and an AI assistant provides a single detailed observation and analysis.

## Key Requirements:
- Make the initial question unique to the case that is presented.
- Assistant provides detailed descriptions of microscopic findings and their significance
- Assistant only references the available microscopic findings to describe what is visible, without directly mentioning a report.
- If there is a lack of findings, keep the description short. If the information below insufficient, state that you are uncertain.
- Description naturally builds toward the diagnostic conclusion: "{{ conclusion }}"
- **Focus only on characteristics observable in microscopic images - avoid mentioning dimensions (mm/cm), anatomical locations, specimen measurements, patient demographics, clinical history, or other macroscopic/clinical information not visible under the microscope, even if they are important to the conclusion.**

## Example Description Flow:
- Start with tissue type identification
- Progress to specific observable features
- Follow up with significance of findings
- Conclude with diagnostic implications

## REFORMULATE THE BELOW CONTEXT INTO THE SCENARIO

The formal diagnosis is: {{ icd10 }}: {{ icd10_text }} ( {{ Diagnosis }} )

Available microscopic findings that the AI assistant observes in the images:
- Microscopic observations: {{ micro_protocol }}
- Additional information: {{ additional_info }}
- Conclusion: {{ conclusion }}
- Differential Diagnostic information: {{ diff_diagnostic }}

## Format: 
OpenAI conversation (double-quoted) JSON with a single "user" (request for clean report) and "assistant" (structured clean report) turn:
{
"user": "Question Here", "assistant": "Answer Here"
}
