# Visual Question-Answering Medical Case Prompt

Generate a multi-turn visual question-answering conversation where a user asks questions about pathology images and an AI assistant provides detailed observations and analysis. The user should start with basic questions and progressively ask more specific follow-up questions based on the assistant's responses.

## Key Requirements:
- User asks simple, direct questions about what they observe in the pathology images
- Assistant provides detailed descriptions of microscopic findings and their significance
- Questions progress from general tissue identification to specific pathological features
- Assistant only references the available microscopic findings to describe what is visible, without directly mentioning a report.
- If there is a lack of findings, keep the conversation short.
- Conversation naturally builds toward the diagnostic conclusion: "{{ conclusion }}"
- **Focus only on characteristics observable in microscopic images - avoid mentioning dimensions (mm/cm), slide or coupe identity information, anatomical locations, specimen measurements, patient demographics, clinical history, or other macroscopic/clinical information not visible under the microscope, even if they are important to the conclusion.**
- If there is a lack of context provided in this prompt create a single question and answer, with basic information and a statement that you cannot see more in this image. **If the information is not given in the context, do not add it on the conversation.**

## Example Conversational Flow:
- Start with tissue type identification
- Progress to specific observable features
- Follow up with significance of findings
- Conclude with diagnostic implications

## REFORMULATE THE BELOW CONTEXT INTO THE SCENARIO
The formal diagnosis is: {{ icd10 }}: {{ icd10_text }} ( {{ Diagnosis }} )

Available microscopic findings that the AI assistant observes in the images:
- Microscopic observations: {{ micro_protocol }}
- Additional information: {{ additional_info }}
- Conclusion: {{ conclusion }}
- Differential Diagnostic information: {{ diff_diagnostic }}

## Format: 
OpenAI conversation (double-quoted) JSON with alternating "user" (questions) and "assistant" (detailed observations) roles:
[
   {
      "user":"<some user question here>",
      "assistant":"<some response by the assistant here>"

   },
   {
      "user":"<some user question here>",
      "assistant":"<some response by the assistant here>"
   }
]
