## REFORMULATE THE BELOW CONTEXT INTO THE SCENARIO

The formal diagnosis is: {{ icd10 }}: {{ icd10_text }} ( {{ Diagnosis }} )

Available microscopic findings that the AI assistant observes in the images:
- Microscopic observations: {{ micro_protocol }}
- Additional information: \{\{ additional_info \}\}
- Conclusion: {{ conclusion }}
- Differential Diagnostic information: {{ diff_diagnostic }}

## Format: 
OpenAI conversation (double-quoted) JSON with exactly 3 question-answer pairs in this exact order:
